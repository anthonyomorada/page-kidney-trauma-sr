# Traumatic Page Kidney: A Systematic Review and Case Report of Bilateral Gerota’s Fascia Release

## Abstract

**Background:**  
Page kidney is a rare but clinically significant phenomenon characterized by hypertension secondary to renal parenchymal compression from subcapsular hematoma or urinoma. Although trauma is a known cause, literature on its surgical management remains sparse. This systematic review aims to consolidate current evidence on traumatic Page kidney (TPK) and highlight a novel case of bilateral involvement managed surgically.

**Methods:**  
We conducted a systematic review of PubMed, Embase, and JBI Evidence-Based Practice databases on March 21, 2023, using the term "Page kidney" in the context of trauma. Two independent reviewers screened 119 abstracts, ultimately including 31 studies that met pre-defined inclusion criteria. Extracted data included patient demographics, trauma mechanism, laterality, clinical presentation, imaging findings, interventions, and outcomes.

**Results:**  
Among the 24 cases, left-sided TPK was most common. A significant proportion involved renal allografts. Hypertension was the most frequent presenting symptom, though time to onset varied widely. Most patients required surgical intervention, including nephrectomy, hematoma evacuation, or capsulotomy, with favorable outcomes and no reported mortalities. Our case—a 54-year-old male with bilateral perinephric hematomas post-MVA—experienced worsening hypertension, acute kidney injury, and eventual anuria. Bilateral Gerota’s fascia release led to resolution of symptoms and return of urinary function.

**Conclusions:**  
This is the first reported case of traumatic bilateral Page kidney managed with bilateral Gerota’s fascia release. Our review highlights the predominance of left-sided involvement, common association with transplant kidneys, and the success of surgical management in resolving TPK. Early recognition and intervention are essential to avoid renal morbidity and the need for dialysis.

**Level of Evidence:**  
Level IV, Therapeutic/Care Management
