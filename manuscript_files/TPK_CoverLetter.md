Dear Editors,

We are pleased to submit our manuscript entitled **“Traumatic Page Kidney: A Systematic Review and Case Report of Bilateral Gerota's Fascia Release”** for consideration for publication in the *Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery*.

This work presents a comprehensive systematic review of trauma-induced Page kidney, synthesizing 24 cases reported in the literature to date, and highlights a novel case of **bilateral Page kidney** managed successfully with **bilateral Gerota’s fascia release**—the first such surgical report in the literature. Given the rarity of the condition and its potentially reversible nature with timely intervention, we believe our findings will be of interest to trauma surgeons, intensivists, and nephrologists alike.

The manuscript adheres to PRISMA 2020 guidelines and provides updated insights on clinical presentation, diagnostic delays, and treatment modalities in traumatic Page kidney. Our findings support surgical decompression in select cases and reinforce the importance of early recognition in trauma patients presenting with unexplained hypertension and renal dysfunction.

This manuscript has not been published and is not under consideration elsewhere. All authors have contributed significantly and approve of the manuscript’s content. We have no conflicts of interest or funding disclosures to report.

Thank you for your time and consideration. We look forward to the opportunity to contribute to the literature through your journal.

Sincerely,  
Anthony Onde Morada, MD
