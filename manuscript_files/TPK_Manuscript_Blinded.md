## Background

First described by Irvine Page in 1939, the Page kidney phenomenon refers to external compression of the renal parenchyma leading to renin-mediated hypertension. The underlying causes have evolved from post-surgical and transplant-related events to iatrogenic and traumatic etiologies. Despite its rarity, the condition can have severe consequences including irreversible kidney injury if not promptly diagnosed and managed.

Previous systematic reviews are outdated, with the most recent major analysis published in 2009. Our study updates the literature with 24 newly identified trauma-associated Page kidney cases and contributes a novel bilateral case requiring operative decompression.

## Methods

A systematic literature review was conducted in PubMed, Embase, and JBI EBP databases on March 21, 2023, using the terms "Page kidney" AND "trauma." Inclusion criteria encompassed any trauma-induced Page kidney case in humans with sufficient clinical data. Two independent reviewers screened titles and abstracts, with full-text assessment to confirm eligibility.

Data extracted included age, sex, laterality, trauma mechanism, prior transplant status, presenting symptoms, diagnostic imaging, time to diagnosis, treatment modality, and outcome. This review adhered to PRISMA 2020 guidelines. The complete search strategy is provided in Supplemental Digital Content 1 (SDC 1). The inclusion/exclusion criteria, screening tool, and data dictionary used during extraction are available in SDC 2. The PRISMA checklist is included as SDC 3

All checklists and tools referenced are uploaded as Supplemental Digital Content (SDC 1–3).

## Results

### Case Report

A 54-year-old unrestrained driver sustained blunt trauma in a motor vehicle collision. He presented with bilateral perinephric hematomas, rib fractures, and scalp laceration. His tertiary exam was unremarkable, but worsening hypertension, anemia, and rising creatinine prompted repeat imaging on hospital day 4.

CT revealed enlarging bilateral zone 2 hematomas. Exploratory laparotomy with bilateral Gerota’s fascia release was performed. Postoperatively, hypertension resolved, anemia stabilized, and urine output returned. He was discharged on postoperative day 7. At 2-week follow-up, renal function had normalized.

This case is the first reported instance of bilateral surgical decompression for traumatic Page kidney.

### Systematic Review

#### Demographics and Clinical Presentation

Among the 33 patients included in our analysis, the mean age was 33 years (range: 2–70), and 76% were male. The most common mechanisms of injury were motor vehicle collisions (33%), falls (18%), and sports-related trauma (15%). Laterality was left-sided in 64% (21/33), right-sided in 24% (8/33), and bilateral in 12% (4/33).

Hypertension was the most common presenting symptom (67%), followed by acute kidney injury (45%) and oliguria/anuria (33%). Median time from injury to diagnosis was 3 days (IQR: 1–6). All patients underwent imaging, most commonly with CT scan.

#### Noteworthy Findings

- **Transplant history**: 6 patients (18%) had a prior kidney transplant; most of these involved compression of an allograft kidney.
- **Treatment**: 24 cases (73%) required surgical intervention, typically hematoma evacuation or Gerota’s fascia release. Non-surgical approaches included percutaneous drainage (15%) and conservative management (12%).
- **Outcomes**: All patients survived. Renal function improved or normalized in 88% of cases post-treatment. Dialysis was required in 18%, but was typically temporary.

## Discussion

This updated review reinforces the pattern of Page kidney presenting with hypertension and renal dysfunction post-trauma. Left-sided predominance and delayed diagnosis remain key themes. Prior transplant patients represent a vulnerable subset.

Surgical decompression is curative in the majority of cases, especially when conservative or percutaneous measures fail. Our case highlights the potential for bilateral involvement—a previously undocumented scenario—and supports early operative management in selected trauma patients.

We advocate for increased awareness among trauma surgeons and nephrologists to avoid diagnostic delay. Clinicians should maintain high suspicion in trauma patients with unexplained hypertension and acute kidney injury.

## Conclusions

Traumatic Page kidney is an uncommon but important cause of secondary hypertension and renal dysfunction following trauma. Surgical intervention, including hematoma evacuation and Gerota’s fascia release, is often necessary for resolution. Our report of bilateral surgical decompression expands the clinical understanding of this phenomenon. Early recognition and management are critical to prevent irreversible renal injury.
