  abstract = {Renal injury after surgical intervention is not uncommon in current urological practice with most complication would be anticipated in high risk patient. Subcapsular renal hematoma is not known complication post some urological interventions such as extracorporeal shockwave lithotripsy (ESWL), percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL) and trauma. Few cases of subcapsular hematomas are reported as a complication post ureteroscopy in the literature. Clinical spectrum varies from spontaneous resolution through acute renal failure secondary to Page kidney. Page kidney is the external compression of a kidney usually caused by a subcapsular hematoma associated with high blood pressure and occasional renal failure. It is named after Dr. Irvin Page who first demonstrated in 1939 that applying external compression on the renal parenchyma could cause hypertension. Various management options are mentioned in literature and depend upon the severity and presentation. Percutaneous drainage is an option for the management of subcapsular hematoma in hemodynamically stable patient.},

He subsequently required cystoscopic insertion of a ureteric stent after failing a trial of conservative management. Over the next 9 months, he re-presented to the hospital twice with increasing flank pain and fevers. Subsequent imaging demonstrated interval progression of the retroperitoneal haematoma with a suspicious calcified lower pole lesion which was biopsied subsequently and revealed malignant tissue. External compression of the kidney by this large haematoma was also thought to be contributing to a state of Page kidney. The patient underwent definitive management with an open left-sided radical nephrectomy which confirmed type 2 papillary renal cell carcinoma. The patient is now normotensive and back to his baseline function. He will undergo surveillance CT imaging and be referred to familial genetic services.},

  abstract = {Background: Page kidney phenomenon is caused by strong renal parenchymal compression and leads to renal hypoperfusion and microvascular ischemia, resulting in renal dysfunction and hypertension. Although the development of Page kidney phenomenon in allograft is rare, most of its cases are induced by allograft biopsy or trauma. We observed a case of Page kidney phenomenon that was induced by unusual causes immediately after kidney transplantation. Case presentation: A 66-year-old man, whose wife donated a kidney, underwent ABO-compatible living kidney transplantation. The allograft had three renal arteries that were trimmed and formed into one piece on the back table, and subsequently, it was anastomosed to the internal iliac artery. Intraoperative Doppler ultrasonography (US) revealed adequate blood flow of each renal artery. Urine output was also observed as soon as allograft blood flow was reperfused. After the surgery, the urine output decreased, and serum creatinine level increased to 6.0 mg/dL. Doppler US did not show evidence of acute rejection, ureteral obstruction, or anastomotic stenosis of the renal arteries. On postoperative day 7, surgical exploration was performed and revealed that the blood flow of each renal artery was adequate but subcapsular hematoma was detected at the upper pole of the allograft. Capsulotomy and hematoma evacuation were performed. Subsequently, urine output increased and serum creatinine level decreased up to 1.7 mg/dL. Allograft sample was obtained 1 h after the transplantation from the lower pole of the allograft. Although the cause of subcapsular bleeding was unclear in this case, a small cyst of the allograft, which might have ruptured during donor nephrectomy, was located in the middle of the hematoma, and oozing around the cyst was observed. Conclusions: Our case indicated that the small ruptured cyst of the allograft could be the cause of subcapsular hematoma and Page kidney phenomenon. Subcapsular hematoma caused by oozing over time could be difficult to diagnose using Doppler US, and thus, other imaging modalities, such as computed tomography, should be considered. Knowledge of the Page kidney phenomenon in the allograft can lead to early diagnosis and intervention, resulting in better outcomes for recipients with allograft dysfunction.},

In a patient with flank pain, elevated blood pressure, and recent trauma, this condition should be considered. Since this condition was first described in 1939, more than 100 case reports have surfaced. Case Report: We describe the case of a 26-year-old man who presented to the Emergency Department with flank pain, vomiting, and elevated blood pressure. A computed tomography scan of the abdomen and pelvis confirmed the presence of a perinephric hematoma, and the interventional radiology team was consulted to resolve the Page kidney. Why Should an Emergency Physician Be Aware of This?: Symptoms seen in Page kidney may be similar to other more common diagnoses encountered in the emergency department. It is important to maintain a high suspicion and order imaging studies as needed, especially in the setting of trauma, or a recent procedure in the vicinity of the renal parenchyma. {\copyright} 2023 Elsevier Inc.

  abstract = {A 67-year-old man presented to the emergency department 22 hours after a trauma to his kidney graft. He was asymptomatic during the first 10 hours, then he became anuric. His serum creatinine level was 2.73 mg/dL (baseline, 0.7 mg/dL), and his hemoglobin concentration was 13.1 g/dL. Computer tomography showed a 4-cm subcapsular hematoma without active bleeding. He underwent urgent decompression of the hematoma, and we did not find any active bleeding or parenchymal laceration. Urinary output had already recovered by the end of surgery without early or late complications. In conclusion, subcapsular hematoma, complicating a traumatic event on a kidney graft, can lead to a progressive parenchymal compression resulting in anuria. So, although in the absence of anemia, such events require urgent surgical decompression. Symptoms cannot be immediate, so all the graft trauma should be investigated with early ultrasound. Little is known in the case of major renal trauma but mildly symptomatic. Probably surgical exploration is better than observation to prevent possible early and late complications such as organ rejection or a Page kidney.},

External compression from a renal hematoma can cause hypertension, and presentation can be delayed following the initial injury. For patients who have a kidney allograft, page kidneys may lead to renal insufficiency and acute renal failure due to the absence of a contralateral kidney to compensate. This case report discusses the identification and management of a page kidney in a kidney allograft recipient within three months following transplantation.},

The initial description of Page kidney, a form of renin-mediated hypertension, included athletes with renal subcapsular hematoma after flank trauma. Subsequently, nontraumatic etiologies were identified. In this study, the authors compare traumatic and nontraumatic causes of Page kidney. All cases with hypertension attributable to renal hematoma at our institution from 1960 to 2010 were reviewed. Twenty-six patients (9 trauma, 17 nontrauma), with a mean age of 36.7{$\quad$}years, were included. Trauma patients were younger (               P               {$<$}.001), had lower systolic blood pressures (               P               =.011), and higher baseline estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), (               P               =.027) at presentation. No differences in presenting features, imaging, urinalysis, or pathology are noted. Nontrauma cases required more antihypertensive medications (               P               =.001) and had higher nephrectomy rates. eGFR improved in all, but more in, trauma cases (               P               =.05). Through the analysis of 26 cases of Page kidney, two distinct groups were identified. Trauma patients tended to be younger, male, have less renal impairment and lower systolic blood pressure. Nontrauma patients required more antihypertensive medications and had a higher nephrectomy rate. New-onset hypertension occurred independent of etiology, calling for close surveillance of blood pressures.},

We report two cases of young males with flank pain, renal mass, and hypertension with history of blunt abdominal trauma. Initially, hypertension was controlled by angiotensinconverting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors but gradually became refractory to medical treatment. Laparoscopic nephrectomy was performed in both patients. We emphasize the Page kidney as a cause of hypertension in young patients, presenting with flank pain and renal mass with or without complications of hypertension. Management is aimed to control blood pressure by ACE inhibitors, aspiration of the hematoma, open hematoma evacuation, or nephrectomy.},

A 67-year-old Caucasian male with a past surgical history of kidney transplant presented to the emergency department at a local hospital with left lower abdominal tenderness. He recalled that his cat, which weighs 15 lbs, jumped on his abdomen 7 d prior. On physical examination, a small tender mass was noticed at the incisional site of the kidney transplant. He was producing a normal amount of urine without hematuria. His serum creatinine level was slightly elevated from his baseline. Computer tomography revealed a large subscapular hematoma around the transplant kidney. The patient was observed to have renal trauma grade II at the hospital over a period of three days, and he was finally transferred to a transplant center after his urine output significantly decreased. Doppler ultrasound demonstrated an extensive peri-allograft hypoechoic area and abnormal waveforms with absent arterial diastolic flow and a patent renal vein. Despite surgical decompression, the allograft failed to respond appropriately due to the delay in surgical intervention. This is the third reported case of allograft loss from acute Page kidney following kidney transplantation. This case reinforces that kidney care differs if the kidney is solitary or a transplant. Early recognition and aggressive treatments are mandatory, especially in a case with Doppler signs that are suggestive of compression.},

All 18 contusions were treated conservatively. For the 24 severe injuries there was a surgery rate of 66\% (16/24), a renal loss rate of 16\% (4/24); the other organs could be saved by the operation. With primarily conservative treatment we had to operate in one case only due to recurrent haematuria; the renal loss rate was 0\%. The following criteria are defined as indications for surgical treatment: (1) deteriorating vital signs, (2) pedicle injury, (3) large devitalized renal segments, (4) large extravasations of contrast medium ("Page kidney").},
